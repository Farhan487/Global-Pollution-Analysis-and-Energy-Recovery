🌍 Project Overview
Objective
Analyze pollution data (air, water, soil) across different countries.

Predict energy recovery from pollution levels using Linear Regression.

Classify countries into pollution severity levels (Low/Medium/High) using Logistic Regression.

Dataset
Global_Pollution_Analysis.csv: Contains pollution indices, CO₂ emissions, industrial waste, and energy recovery data.

⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/global-pollution-analysis.git
cd global-pollution-analysis
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(or manually install: pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn)

🚀 Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook
bash
jupyter notebook
Open Global_Pollution_Analysis.ipynb and execute cells step by step.

2. Key Steps
🔍 Phase 1: Data Exploration (EDA)
Load and clean the dataset.

Check for missing values.

Normalize pollution indices.

Visualize trends (CO₂ emissions, pollution over time).

🤖 Phase 2: Predictive Modeling
Linear Regression: Predicts Energy_Recovered from pollution data.

Logistic Regression: Classifies countries into pollution severity levels.

📊 Phase 3: Insights & Recommendations
Identifies high-pollution, low-energy-recovery countries.

Suggests policy improvements.

📈 Results
1. Linear Regression (Energy Recovery Prediction)
R² Score: Measures how well the model explains energy recovery.

MSE (Mean Squared Error): Average prediction error.

2. Logistic Regression (Pollution Classification)
Accuracy: Percentage of correct classifications.

Confusion Matrix: Shows true vs. predicted pollution levels.
